turner-bohlen is a nodejs app that will work as the host for my new website.

# Structure

### Server


Views will be stored in their own folders withing the views directory. Views can
be requested and provided one at a time to the user. Each view should consist of
exactly one style sheet, one javascript, and one html doc for now. This will
become more flexible in the future.
